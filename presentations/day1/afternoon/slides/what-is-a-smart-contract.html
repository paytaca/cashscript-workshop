    BTW, When we're talking about smart contracts we're talking about smart contracts in bitcoin cash.
    Think of it like a 'vault'.
    
    A regular vault only opens with the right key or code.
    A Bitcoin Cash smart contract vault can be programmed with custom rules about when and how it opens.
    For example:
      You can set it so the vault opens only if two out of three people turn their keys (multisig).
      Or it can open only after a certain date (timelock).
      Or even require a combination of conditions: two people must agree and it must be after a certain date.
      Just like a vault automatically enforces its rules—without needing a guard or a judge—the Bitcoin Cash 
      blockchain automatically enforces the smart contract’s conditions. No one can cheat the vault: either the
      exact rules are met, or it stays locked.

    Why is this powerful? Because the can or cannot be spend based on the piece of code. It's incorruptable.
